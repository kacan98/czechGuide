But let's be fair—Prague is a stunning city and definitely worth a visit. So here's a short, no-nonsense guide to the essentials: what I'd eat, where I'd go, and the things you really shouldn't miss if it's your first time in Prague. Quick, simple, and hopefully useful—without drowning you in \"top 100\" lists.",
